# JS Menus Library

This JavaScript library allows developers to easily create and manipulate custom UI menus — including options menus, contextual menus, popup menus, and contextual action modes. Modeled after Android-style interactions, it's a versatile toolkit for any UI-heavy application.

## Features

- Create and delete **options menus**, **popup menus**, and **contextual menus**.
- Contextual and popup menus require a `menuName` for unique handling.
- Contextual menus can be **anchored** to elements for Android-style presentation.
- All menus are fully **customizable** via exported style and configuration functions.
- Simple function calls for showing and hiding menus dynamically.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML5/CSS3

## Notes

This was one of the earliest libraries built during the developer’s learning curve. It reflects experimentation with pure JS to emulate native mobile behaviors on the web.
